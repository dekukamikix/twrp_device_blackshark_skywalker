This TWRP device tree for Xiaomi Blackshark 2 (SKW-H0) pulled from JoyUI 11 20200925 OS01 MQ2 firmware. I built the tree because there is another TWRP built only for Android 9 bootloader/firmware, and didn't share the device tree source. 

Next I'll try to build device tree for custom roms too (if I got spare time).
